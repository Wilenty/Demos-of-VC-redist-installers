	v21.09.09 (2021-09-09):

Here you can use any of VC++ 2015/2017/2019/2022 runtimes as EXTERNAL directly from original installers, command line parameter: /SelectVcVersion="EXT".

New command-line parameters:
/VC_redistX64="Full Path (with spaces) to the VC_redist.x64.exe"
and
 /VC_redistX86="Full Path (with spaces) to the VC_redist.x86.exe"
You need to use both parameters above to change both locations of the installers to use, if they are different than installer location.
